# Calculatory GUI
**About**: This is a very simple calculator I made while working on my Directed Reading Program research project in Fall 2016. The Directed Reading Program, offered through the University of Maryland mathematics department, is a research program designed for undergraduate students. I was designated a graduate student mentor. This was a collaborative research project between my mentor, Sean Ballentine, and me. Our topic was coding theory and error detection. We were able to develop an algorithm for constructing optimal binary codes, such that errors could be more easily detected.

**Purpose**: The sole purpose of this calculator was so that I could easily plug in and test different values as we developed our algorithm. I made the calculator myself using the Java Swing library. Unfortunately, I lost my source code... :(
This was a relatively quickly implemented project, but turned out to be rather helpful during our research.

**Brief description of calculator**: We were developing an algorithm for constructing binary codes so that they would have the largest Hamming distance between each other, making any errors more easily detectable.  The variables *n*, *t*, *s_1*, and *s_2* are just the four sections that we divided the binary codes into.  We then used this calculator to gain an idea about what happens to the Hamming distance of two binary codes when certain sections of the code have a different number of zeros or ones.
